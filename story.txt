Aka manto: an urban legend in Japan talk about a masked spirit who wears a red cloak and appear when people using toilet in public or school. Story start at late in the evening in a school, a student finds him in desperate need of a toilet then he does his business in school toilet. When he finished, he found out that there is no toilet paper. Aka manto appear with a strange voice: “Do you want red paper? Or blue paper?” The student answers, “Red paper,” and afterthat moment, he is stabbed and sliced up so violently that blood sprays everywhere, soaking his body and making it look as if he were wearing a bright red cloak. Later another student stuck with the situation but he chose “Blue paper.” Then, all of the student’s blood is sucked out of their body, leaving he dead and blue-faced on the floor.

Aka manto is most often used by parents to scare their kids into staying away from public bathrooms, because they are often unsanitary. However, a much more pg version of the above story is used, in order not to scare them too much.
